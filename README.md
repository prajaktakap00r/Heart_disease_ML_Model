A Machine Learning Classification Model which is used to detect Whether the Pateint have heart disease on not. Based on different Parameters given in csv file(Dataset) we can find the patterns.

We can use differnet classification models like Logistic Regression, RandomForest, KNearestNeighbors .
We can comapre these models and choose the one with highest accuracy.
In my case, Logistic regression is most accurate.
After geeting the Accurate model you can perform hyperparameter tuning to increase the accuracy.
