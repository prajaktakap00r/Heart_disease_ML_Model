A Machine Learning Classification Model which is used to detect Whether the Pateint have heart disease on not. Based on different Parameters given in csv file(Dataset) we can find the patterns.

We can use differnet classification models like Logistic Regression, RandomForest, KNearestNeighbors .
We can comapre these models and choose the one with highest accuracy.
In my case, Logistic regression is most accurate.
After geeting the Accurate model you can perform hyperparameter tuning to increase the accuracy.

Several machine learning algorithms suitable for classification tasks were considered for this project, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Trees. However, given the nature of the classification problem and the need for models capable of handling categorical outcomes effectively, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) were selected as the primary algorithms for evaluation.

Logistic Regression:
Chosen for its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness in binary classification tasks, Logistic Regression was deemed suitable for this project.
Random Forest:
Random Forest, renowned for its robustness and ability to handle complex datasets, was included to explore its performance in comparison to Logistic Regression.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
KNN, a non-parametric algorithm, was selected for its simplicity and intuitive approach to classification tasks, serving as another baseline model for comparison.
Other models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Trees were not chosen due to various reasons including complexity, computational requirements, or their performance not being significantly superior to the selected models for this particular dataset and problem statement.

By focusing on Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of both linear and non-linear approaches in predicting cardiovascular health outcomes based on the provided features.
